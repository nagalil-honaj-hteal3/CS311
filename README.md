# CS311
**Data Structures and Algorithms - CSUSM**

***Taught by Professor Kazumi Slott*** -- Fall 2021

*Pre-requisite for CS311 -- CS211 or equivalent. Must have prior experience implementing the stack, queue, linked list and binary search
tree classes in C++ or Java. If you have not, check my cs211 as reference. You must have already passed discrete math (MATH 270 or
350) or must be currently taking it to stay in this class. Also you must have passed CS111 and MATH 160
(calculus I).*

***Description:*** A thorough understanding of several advanced methods for implementing the abstract data types and the time used by each method.  Includes abstract data types such as dictionary, priority queues, matrices, and relations, foundation of recursive algorithms, complexity analysis, complexity classes, sorting and searching, computability and undecidability, problem-solving strategies, heuristic search, modeling and components of database systems, and graphics software systems.  

**Mission:** You will learn new data structures and algorithms and learn to choose the right data structure and the right algorithm. Upside for taking the class are as follows: 

 • Have you select or come up with the right data structure and the right algorithm for a variety of
problems.

 • Help you see that algorithms and data structures are closely related. For example, a particular
algorithm may work only with a given data structure.

 • Have you evaluate and emphasize modularity, information hiding, and efficiency in program design.

 • Help prepare you for the 400 level classes and job interviews.

The material covered will be based on the following:
-  Complexity - Big O, omega and theta
-  STL/ Template / Vector
-  Stack class, Queue class
-  Operator=, copy constructor
-  Exception handling
-  Matrix
-  Inheritance/a linked list of pointers to parent or child objects
-  Recursion that returns a value (fact(n), binary search), void (tower of Hanoi)
-  Selection, bubble, insertion, quick, merge, radix sort
-  String matching
-  Knapsack problem - Maximizing the profit in filling a knapsack – finding the least wasteful way to cut raw
-  materials
-  BST – delete, Bread first and depth first traversals
-  Balanced search tree - AVL, multi-way tree
-  Hash function, collision resolution
-  Heap sort and priority queue
-  Graph – implementation, search/traversal, greedy algo minimum spanning tree, shortest path
-  Huffman tree for compressing data
-  P vs NP and Heuristics
